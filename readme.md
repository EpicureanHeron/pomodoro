# Pomodoro Project

## Coursera Project

This is a project for the Coursera course [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

The inspiration is from the Week 1 Video, A Procrastination Preview, which discusses the [Pomodoro Techinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

It is a time management tool to overcome procrastination and encourage effective learning.

This app was built to be a simple implementation of a timer app.

The timer runs for 25 minutes, it offers little bits of advice, notes from the Coursera course itself, and nudges to work.

It then transitions to a relaxation mode for 5 minutes.

The content on the screen remains minimal. The color of the screen transitions between phases to nudge the learner to the correct mode.

The colors are based on shakey phsychology found [here](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning)

Blue is said to help with concentration.

Orange is said to be a mood lifter.
